# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML-GRIP-JULY21
This task is to predict the score of the student for the given number of hours. Since, we have only 2 variables i.e hours(independent variable) and scores(dependent variable) we can use Simple Linear Regression. I have solved this problem using R-programme.
